Author: Aryan Bahinipati

Description:
    This script reads a list of song names and video URLs from a CSV file (songs.csv),
    and uses multiple threads to download the videos using yt-dlp.
    Each video is saved with its corresponding song name as the filename.

Requirements:
    - yt-dlp
    - Python 3.6+
